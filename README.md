## Installation/Running

0. Install dependencies: `yarn install`.
0. Start running webpack to build bundle.js: `npx webpack -w`.
0. Run server: `npx ts-node ./bin/serve`.
0. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## TODO

0. Add some element of "time" so that you don't ask the same ones repeatedly?
  * Or will this already be solved by a smarter technique for sorting
    using confidence intervals?
